        <p> What if we focused on what is right with our children instead of  what is wrong? <br><br> Help develop your child’s
            natural talents with <i>Strengths Based Parenting</i> by Mary Reckmeyer and Jennifer Robison. Unlike many parenting
            books, <i>Strengths Based Parenting</i> focuses on identifying and understanding what your children are naturally good
            at and where they thrive — not on their weaknesses. The book also helps you uncover your own innate talents and
            effectively apply them to your individual parenting style. </p>
